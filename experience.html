            <h5>Greentree Outdoor Living - Project Coordinator</h5>
            <p>Edmonton, AB </p>
            <p>Seasonal work</p>
            <p>Responsibilities included the tracking of all project budgets, requesting and organization of all
                permits, grades, and dig locates for all projects. Data base entry, organization and maintenance - I am
                most proud of formulating new data base system that was shared company-wide to allow all information to
                be available to management, employees, sales and designers. I worked closely with a consultant to
                develop form system for foremen to relay information to office regarding their employees and project
                hours</p>
            <p>My communication skills involved accepting reports from all company foremen and working with them to
                teach them to use the form that I helped develop to make them more efficient. Client interactions
                included introductory packages to problem resolution. I became a joint safety committee member and
                attended meetings and had one on one conversations with employees to help them to resolve work place
                issues.</p>
            <p>During my time with this employer, there wasn't any formal training, and I made it a point to learn
                "AirTable" database program from having no knowledge to developing company templates to unify
                information.

            <h5>Allstone Inc. - Office Manager</h5>
            <p>Edmonton, AB</p>
            <p>During the initial time of my employment with Allstone I started in the shop, as a Stone Sawyer. This
                involved loading the saw, mapping out cuts, and operating the saw. This also involved working closely
                with the CNC Operator, to help load, and unload the CNC machine. I also hand edged and polished during
                my time in the shop.</p>
            <p>Upon seeing a need for office help, a position was created for me, as a trial period. I excelled, so the
                trial period was cancelled. My responsiblites included scheduling template and installation
                appointments, all office administration duties, Accounts Receivable tracking and customer invoicing. I
                also performed Executive Assistant duties to the CEO, and did quoting for large companies and walk-in
                clients.</p>
            <p>While in this position, I created an office filing system that didn't exist before I arrived. I created a
                Employee Handbook, and policy guide for the company when I saw a need for it. They used a quoting
                program, Moraware, that I had no working knowledge of. I used my own time to learn
                the program, and performed monthly updates to ensure its function was optimized. In order to make this
                more successful, I created an Excel data base with all materials that were used by the company, that
                created price lists and material information.</p>
            <p>I also helped foster a sales relationship between Allstone and Bristol Sinks, in Ontario, to offer sinks
                and faucets to our clients. I worked closely with the Area Representative to ensure a profitable
                relationship. </p>
